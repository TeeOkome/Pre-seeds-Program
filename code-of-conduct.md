# Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge
We, as contributors and maintainers of this project, are committed to fostering an **open**, **welcoming**, and **harassment-free** environment for everyone. We pledge to ensure that participation in our community is inclusive and safe for all, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender, level of experience, education, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, or socio-economic status. We strive to create a space where people feel empowered to contribute without fear of discrimination or harassment and learn and grow in the process.

### Our Standards
To promote a positive and productive environment, participants are expected to:
- Use welcoming and respectful language.
- Be considerate of differing viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism and strive to learn from mistakes.
- Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward others.
- Focus on the collective success of the community and project.

Unacceptable behaviours include but are not limited to:
- The use of sexualized language, images, or unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Insults, derogatory comments, trolling, or personal and political attacks.
- Harassment, intimidation, stalking, or inappropriate social contact.
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Threats of violence, incitement to violence, or encouraging self-harm.
- Discriminatory jokes or using derogatory slurs related to identity.
- Sustained disruption of discussions, either in public or private channels.

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces associated with the project, including but not limited to project repositories, mailing lists, issue trackers, events (online or offline), and public representation of the project in other venues, such as social media. This also includes interactions outside of project spaces when they affect the community, such as harassment at events or other forms of misconduct that may harm our community's reputation.

Certain project spaces may have additional rules specific to their nature, which participants are expected to follow alongside this Code of Conduct.

### Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct and ensuring compliance in project spaces. They are empowered to take corrective actions, which may include:
- Warning the participant involved.
- Removing comments, commits, code, or other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.
- Temporarily or permanently banning contributors or participants whose behaviour is deemed inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

### Reporting and Handling Issues
If you witness or experience any behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, or if you have concerns regarding the safety of our community, please report it by contacting the project team at:

- debs@we-are-ols.org
- okomebtosan@gmail.com

When reporting, please provide as much information as possible, including:
- Your contact details.
- A description of the incident, including any individuals involved, witnesses, and if the incident is ongoing.
- Any supporting documentation, such as screenshots or relevant links.

All complaints will be handled with discretion and confidentiality. If the report involves a member of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling the issue. In such cases, another member of the project team will manage the report.

### Confidentiality and Transparency
We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of reporters and victims. In certain situations, if it’s necessary to ensure the safety of the community or the general public, we may take further action by privately warning third parties or publicly naming the individual responsible for unacceptable behaviour. We will only name victims with their affirmative consent.

### Acknowledgement of Mistakes
Our community seeks to treat everyone as fairly and equally as possible. When mistakes happen, we expect members to take responsibility for their actions. If someone is harmed or offended, we are committed to listening carefully and respectfully, learning from the incident, and taking steps to make things right.

### Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from various open-source community codes, including the Open Life Science, Contributor Covenant (version 2.0), Geek Feminism, and CHAOSS, which promote inclusive and harassment-free participation.
